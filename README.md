## Hexonite.net

Hexonite Software Services is registered as a business in the state of California, United States of America.

Hexonite.net also serves my personal website, showcasing my profile and soon a blog. It also has a contact page that will send me an email containing the user's name, email address, and any message they typed in. None of the information is used for any purpose other than informational and to establish communication between me and the user. However, the contact page is protected by hCaptcha to prevent receiving spam and bot messages, and using the contact form means accepting their terms of service and privacy terms, which can be found [here](https://www.hcaptcha.com/terms) and [here](https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy).

I started this website from a template that I purchased from [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/) on 2024-01-17. I heavily modified the template to fit my needs and theme. Many of the original template elements and styles are still in place, but not used. I plan to customize all of the styles eventually.

This website was built on top of a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate.
